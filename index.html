		<h1>Drexel Interstellar</h1>
		<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
		<q>To achievee maned interstellar flight by 2100 </q>
		
		
		<q>The unrelenting quest to reach our neighbouring solar systems by 2100!</q>
		
		

		<p> -Advanced propulsion systems such as nuclear fusion, antimatter, and warp field mechanics are currently being
		     researched in the world and have a promising future. </p>
		<p>-Many other topics including advances in spacesuit technology,  0g agriculture, human biology, and societies in
		 space (just to name a few) will also be essential in feasible interstellar flight.</p>
		<p>-Bringing an outsider's perspective in on these topics has the very real potential to yield discovery (as has been
		 seen many times in the past).</p>
		 <p>-We will carry out interstellar research through discussions, student run lectures, and simple experiments.</p>
